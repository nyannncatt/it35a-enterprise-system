Research title: "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation - Toyota

     1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
      -To boost productivity, simplify processes, and adhere to lean manufacturing principles, 
       Toyota used an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Manufacturing, supply chain management, 
       finance, and procurement are just a few of the business operations that the ERP system integrates 
       to enable better departmental decision-making and real-time data exchange.

     2. implementation process
      -Toyota started by assessing its current procedures to see which ones would profit from automation
       and integration. Simplifying processes, increasing data visibility, and strengthening decision-making skills 
       were the main objectives of this evaluation.

     3. Key success factors
      -By integrating various business functions, such as finance, human resources, supply chain management, and 
      manufacturing operations, Toyota has achieved significant improvements in efficiency and productivity. This aligns
      with best practices in tailored IT solutions that are essential for optimizing organizational performance.

     4. outcomes & impact
      -Toyota is able to produce a greater variety of products with higher quality and at lower cost than its competitors.
      It is able to bring new models from the drawing board to production in far shorter time than any of its U.S. or European competitors.
      And the workers on the line have a better sense of who their customers are and what their customers desire in product and experience
      of ownership than any of the line workers at the Big Three here in the U.S.This demonstrates clearly, in my mind, how the Toyota Way 
      makes every employee a “business strategist,” and how doing so produces better and more consistent products–not just year after year, 
      but decade after decade. Most U.S. companies can only dream of such stability and success.

Case study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation - Revlon

     1. company overview (Reason for implementing the enterprise system)
      -As part of the restructuring, Revlon found itself needing to integrate its processes across business units. Both the brands decided 
      to streamline their operations and integrate their ERP. Elizabeth Arden was an early adopter of Oracle Fusion Applications while Revlon ran 
      on Microsoft Dynamics AX . As most of Revlon’s acquired brands ran on SAP, the company decided to migrate to a new ERP model SAP S/4HANA 
     (See Exhibit II).

     2. implementation process & challenges
      -In March 2019, cosmetics giant Revlon announced that it would be late filing its annual financial report for the year prior. The reason
      behind the delay? The company’s year-old SAP ERP system had been riddled with issues ever since implementation. The resulting fallout cost Revlon 
      valuable retail sales and hindered operations. Upon the announcement of the Revlon ERP failure, the company’s stock fell 6.9% in 24 hours.

     3. Key failure factors
      - The company cited lack of design and identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting due to the implementation
     of the new ERP system. Revlon's ERP system failed after it went live in 2018, resulting in a loss of sales, a dip in stock price, and investor lawsuits.
     Revlon implemented a robust service recovery plan and resolved the service level disruptions resulting from failure of the ERP.

     4. outcomes & consequences
      -the system caused service-level disruptions that affected Revlon’s production and distribution capabilities. The company could not fulfil
      product shipments of approximately $64 million of net sales to several large retail customers in the U.S. The company also incurred $53.6 million 
      of incremental charges to remediate the decline in customer service levels.b The SAP failure significantly impacted Revlon’s financial performance and
      reporting. The company reported a net loss of $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company also delayed filing its annual financial report 
      for 2018 due to material weakness in its internal controls related to the SAP implementation.

Toyota focused on operational efficiency through ERP aligned with lean principles.
Revlon aimed to unify disparate systems across its brands to improve overall operations.

2. Implementation Process & Challenges
Toyota: Carefully evaluated existing processes, ensuring smooth integration for enhanced visibility and decision-making.
Revlon: Faced major issues post-implementation of SAP S/4HANA, resulting in a delayed financial report and service disruptions.

Comparison:
Toyota's implementation was well-planned and executed.
Revlon struggled with poor planning, leading to system failures and disruptions.

3. Success/Failure Factors
Toyota: Achieved success by integrating business functions, improving efficiency, and reducing costs.
Revlon: Failed due to poor system design, internal control weaknesses, and lack of a solid transition plan.

Comparison:
Toyota’s careful integration led to better efficiency.
Revlon’s poor implementation resulted in operational and financial losses.

4. Outcomes & Impact
Toyota: Achieved faster product development, higher quality, and lower costs, gaining a competitive edge.
Revlon: Suffered $64 million in unfulfilled shipments, $53.6 million in additional charges, and a $70.3 million loss in Q4 2018.

Comparison:
Toyota saw improved operations and market performance.
