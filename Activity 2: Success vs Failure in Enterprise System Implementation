Research title: "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation - Toyota
     1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
      -To boost productivity, simplify processes, and adhere to lean manufacturing principles, 
       Toyota used an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Manufacturing, supply chain management, 
       finance, and procurement are just a few of the business operations that the ERP system integrates 
       to enable better departmental decision-making and real-time data exchange.

     2. implementation process
      -Toyota started by assessing its current procedures to see which ones would profit from automation
       and integration. Simplifying processes, increasing data visibility, and strengthening decision-making skills 
       were the main objectives of this evaluation.

     3. Key success factors
      -By integrating various business functions, such as finance, human resources, supply chain management, and 
      manufacturing operations, Toyota has achieved significant improvements in efficiency and productivity. This aligns
      with best practices in tailored IT solutions that are essential for optimizing organizational performance.

     4. outcomes & impact
      -Toyota is able to produce a greater variety of products with higher quality and at lower cost than its competitors.
      It is able to bring new models from the drawing board to production in far shorter time than any of its U.S. or European competitors.
      And the workers on the line have a better sense of who their customers are and what their customers desire in product and experience
      of ownership than any of the line workers at the Big Three here in the U.S.This demonstrates clearly, in my mind, how the Toyota Way 
      makes every employee a “business strategist,” and how doing so produces better and more consistent products–not just year after year, 
      but decade after decade. Most U.S. companies can only dream of such stability and success.
